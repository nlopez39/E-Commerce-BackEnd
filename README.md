## Installation

To install this project into your own, use git clone in your command-line.

## Usage

To use this project,

1. Go to the cloned files, connect to the MySQL Terminal and create the database by running `source schema.sql`. Make sure you are under the 'db' file path.
2. Open a new terminal and run `npm run seed` to import the database tables. Be sure youâ€™re in the correct location in your terminal first! (the Develop folder path)
3. Then run `npm start` to start the server.
4. Next, send HTTP requests to the server from any client API of your choice. For this project, Insomnia was used to send GET, PUT, POST and DELETE requests.
